Project Overview
This project involves a complete pipeline for text classification, from data preparation to model training using ensemble learning techniques. The following steps were carried out:

* Data Extraction:
    Loaded and structured the dataset into two columns: class and text.

* Data Preprocessing:
    Applied standard Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, including:
  
        - Tokenization
  
        - Lowercasing and punctuation removal
  
        - Stop word removal
  
        - Lemmatization

* Feature Extraction:
  Employed the TF-IDF (Term Frequencyâ€“Inverse Document Frequency) method to transform text data into numerical features.

* Feature Selection:
  Selected the most relevant features to improve model performance and reduce dimensionality.

* Modeling:
  Utilized an ensemble learning approach based on majority voting to enhance classification accuracy and robustness.
